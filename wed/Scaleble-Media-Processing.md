# Scalable Media Processing with AWS

Didn't talk about storage as much as I hoped.

Mentioned using S3 for storage, pulling things down onto either local
disk or EBS, processing then pushing back to S3.

Talked aabout a few products that can work with s3 and make it more like
a filesystem (though I'm still not convinced this is the right thing to
do - but might be worth looking at);

* s3fs
* twin strata

Also mentioned gluster for shared file systems.
